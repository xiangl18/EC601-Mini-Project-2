How To Use
---
For users who run this project for the first time:  
1. Please dowload all files to one folder you have created, then please put your images needed for building dataset into two different folders. In this project, our goal is to classify the cars and trucks, so we need to put all the cars images into a folder named 'car', and put all the trucks images we have gatherd into a folder named 'truck'. 
2. Please make sure that this two folder are in the same path as the codes downloaded in step 1. The path should be like the following example:    
>-unprocessed_images_example  
>>-truck  
>>-car  
  
  As it shows in unprocessed_images_example. 

3. Then please run the rename.py, and create_dataset.py, whcih will create a data set as:  
As it shows in dataset_example.  
4. 
  

if you choose the search method. Please input them by order, then you will get the images and the video made by these images in the folder you have input before.
